Python Program to Check Leap Year
Python Program to Check Leap Year
In this program, you will learn to check whether a year is leap year or not. We will use nested if...else to solve this problem.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

Python Operators
Python if...else Statement
A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. For example,

2017 is not a leap year
1900 is a not leap year
2012 is a leap year
2000 is a leap year
Source Code
# Python program to check if year is a leap year or not

year = 2000

# To get year (integer input) from the user
# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4) == 0:
   if (year % 100) == 0:
       if (year % 400) == 0:
           print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
       else:
           print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
   else:
       print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
else:
   print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
