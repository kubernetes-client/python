        The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place.
