Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired\"}  If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value.

This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true   - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"  Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:    \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",    \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\". Examples:   - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}   - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}   - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}  Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].
