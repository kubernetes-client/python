The value is null for DELETE requests. - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.   For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'. - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the   request resource.  The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.  Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:    \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",    \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\". Examples:   - Expression accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"Expression\": \"object.__namespace__ > 0\"}   - Expression accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"Expression\": \"object.x__dash__prop > 0\"}   - Expression accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"Expression\": \"object.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}  Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order. Required.")

If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'.
