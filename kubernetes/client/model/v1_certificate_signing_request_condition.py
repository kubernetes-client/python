            type (str): type of the condition. Known conditions are \"Approved\", \"Denied\", and \"Failed\".  An \"Approved\" condition is added via the /approval subresource, indicating the request was approved and should be issued by the signer.  A \"Denied\" condition is added via the /approval subresource, indicating the request was denied and should not be issued by the signer.  A \"Failed\" condition is added via the /status subresource, indicating the signer failed to issue the certificate.  Approved and Denied conditions are mutually exclusive. Approved, Denied, and Failed conditions cannot be removed once added.  Only one condition of a given type is allowed.  Possible enum values:  - `\"Approved\"` Approved indicates the request was approved and should be issued by the signer.  - `\"Denied\"` Denied indicates the request was denied and should not be issued by the signer.  - `\"Failed\"` Failed indicates the signer failed to issue the certificate.
