        Args:
            client_config (AdmissionregistrationV1beta1WebhookClientConfig):
            name (str): The name of the admission webhook. Name should be fully qualified, e.g., imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where \"imagepolicy\" is the name of the webhook, and kubernetes.io is the name of the organization. Required.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the

                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            admission_review_versions ([str]): AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the failure policy. Default to `['v1beta1']`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            failure_policy (str): FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Ignore.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            match_policy (str): matchPolicy defines how the \"rules\" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are \"Exact\" or \"Equivalent\".  - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but \"rules\" only included `apiGroups:[\"apps\"], apiVersions:[\"v1\"], resources: [\"deployments\"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.  - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and \"rules\" only included `apiGroups:[\"apps\"], apiVersions:[\"v1\"], resources: [\"deployments\"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.  Defaults to \"Exact\". [optional]  # noqa: E501
            namespace_selector (V1LabelSelector): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            object_selector (V1LabelSelector): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            reinvocation_policy (str): reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation. Allowed values are \"Never\" and \"IfNeeded\".  Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a single admission evaluation.  IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one additional time as part of the admission evaluation if the object being admitted is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call. Webhooks that specify this option *must* be idempotent, able to process objects they previously admitted. Note: * the number of additional invocations is not guaranteed to be exactly one. * if additional invocations result in further modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again. * webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of additional invocations. * to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed complete, use a validating admission webhook instead.  Defaults to \"Never\".. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            rules ([V1beta1RuleWithOperations]): Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule. However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            side_effects (str): SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable values are: Unknown, None, Some, NoneOnDryRun Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some. Defaults to Unknown.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            timeout_seconds (int): TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default to 30 seconds.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
