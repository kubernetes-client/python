        Args:
            max_skew (int): MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
            topology_key (str): TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a \"bucket\", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.
            when_unsatisfiable (str): WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,   but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the   skew. A constraint is considered \"Unsatisfiable\" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate \"MaxSkew\" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.  Possible enum values:  - `\"DoNotSchedule\"` instructs the scheduler not to schedule the pod when constraints are not satisfied.  - `\"ScheduleAnyway\"` instructs the scheduler to schedule the pod even if constraints are not satisfied.

                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when

                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal

                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
