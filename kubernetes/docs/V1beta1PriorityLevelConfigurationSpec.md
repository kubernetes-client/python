# V1beta1PriorityLevelConfigurationSpec

PriorityLevelConfigurationSpec specifies the configuration of a priority level.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | &#x60;type&#x60; indicates whether this priority level is subject to limitation on request execution.  A value of &#x60;\&quot;Exempt\&quot;&#x60; means that requests of this priority level are not subject to a limit (and thus are never queued) and do not detract from the capacity made available to other priority levels.  A value of &#x60;\&quot;Limited\&quot;&#x60; means that (a) requests of this priority level _are_ subject to limits and (b) some of the server&#39;s limited capacity is made available exclusively to this priority level. Required. | 
**limited** | [**V1beta1LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration**](V1beta1LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
