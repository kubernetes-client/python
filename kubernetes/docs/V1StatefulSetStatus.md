# V1StatefulSetStatus

StatefulSetStatus represents the current state of a StatefulSet.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**available_replicas** | **int** | Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this statefulset. This is a beta field and enabled/disabled by StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate. | 
**collision_count** | **int** | collisionCount is the count of hash collisions for the StatefulSet. The StatefulSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision. | [optional] 
**conditions** | [**list[V1StatefulSetCondition]**](V1StatefulSetCondition.md) | Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset&#39;s current state. | [optional] 
**current_replicas** | **int** | currentReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by currentRevision. | [optional] 
**current_revision** | **str** | currentRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [0,currentReplicas). | [optional] 
**observed_generation** | **int** | observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this StatefulSet. It corresponds to the StatefulSet&#39;s generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server. | [optional] 
**ready_replicas** | **int** | readyReplicas is the number of pods created for this StatefulSet with a Ready Condition. | [optional] 
**replicas** | **int** | replicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller. | 
**update_revision** | **str** | updateRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [replicas-updatedReplicas,replicas) | [optional] 
**updated_replicas** | **int** | updatedReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by updateRevision. | [optional]
