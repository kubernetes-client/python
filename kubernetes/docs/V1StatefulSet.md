# V1StatefulSet

StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested. The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
