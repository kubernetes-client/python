# NetworkingV1beta1HTTPIngressPath

HTTPIngressPath associates a path with a backend. Incoming urls matching the path are forwarded to the backend.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**backend** | [**NetworkingV1beta1IngressBackend**](NetworkingV1beta1IngressBackend.md) |  | 
**path** | **str** | Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \&quot;path\&quot; part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a &#39;/&#39;. When unspecified, all paths from incoming requests are matched. | [optional] 
**path_type** | **str** | PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by &#39;/&#39;. Matching is   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the   list of labels in the path split by the &#39;/&#39; separator. A request is a   match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the   request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar   matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to support all path types. Defaults to ImplementationSpecific. | [optional]
