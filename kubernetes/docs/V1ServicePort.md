# V1ServicePort

ServicePort contains information on service's port.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**app_protocol** | **str** | The application protocol for this port. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the &#39;name&#39; field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service. | [optional] 
**node_port** | **int** | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport | [optional] 
**port** | **int** | The port that will be exposed by this service. | 
**protocol** | **str** | The IP protocol for this port. Supports \&quot;TCP\&quot;, \&quot;UDP\&quot;, and \&quot;SCTP\&quot;. Default is TCP.  Possible enum values:  - &#x60;\&quot;SCTP\&quot;&#x60; is the SCTP protocol.  - &#x60;\&quot;TCP\&quot;&#x60; is the TCP protocol.  - &#x60;\&quot;UDP\&quot;&#x60; is the UDP protocol. | [optional] 
**target_port** | [**object**](.md) | Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod&#39;s container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the &#39;port&#39; field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP&#x3D;None, and should be omitted or set equal to the &#39;port&#39; field.
