# kubernetes.client.model.v1_aws_elastic_block_store_volume_source.V1AWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource

Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.  An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

### Dictionary Keys
Key | Input Type | Accessed Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**volumeID** | str,  | str,  | volumeID is unique ID of the persistent disk resource in AWS (Amazon EBS volume). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore | 
**fsType** | str,  | str,  | fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount. Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system. Examples: \&quot;ext4\&quot;, \&quot;xfs\&quot;, \&quot;ntfs\&quot;. Implicitly inferred to be \&quot;ext4\&quot; if unspecified. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore | [optional] 
**partition** | decimal.Decimal, int,  | decimal.Decimal,  | partition is the partition in the volume that you want to mount. If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name. Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as \&quot;1\&quot;. Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is \&quot;0\&quot; (or you can leave the property empty). | [optional] value must be a 32 bit integer
**readOnly** | bool,  | BoolClass,  | readOnly value true will force the readOnly setting in VolumeMounts. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore | [optional] 
**any_string_name** | dict, frozendict.frozendict, str, date, datetime, int, float, bool, decimal.Decimal, None, list, tuple, bytes, io.FileIO, io.BufferedReader | frozendict.frozendict, str, BoolClass, decimal.Decimal, NoneClass, tuple, bytes, FileIO | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
