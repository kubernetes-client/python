# kubernetes.client.model.v1beta2_limited_priority_level_configuration.V1beta2LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration

LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits. It addresses two issues:   - How are requests for this priority level limited?   - What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?

**assuredConcurrencyShares** | decimal.Decimal, int,  | decimal.Decimal,  | &#x60;assuredConcurrencyShares&#x60; (ACS) configures the execution limit, which is a limit on the number of requests of this priority level that may be exeucting at a given time.  ACS must be a positive number. The server&#x27;s concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:              ACV(l) &#x3D; ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )  bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL). This field has a default value of 30. | [optional] value must be a 32 bit integer
