# V1TokenRequestSpec

TokenRequestSpec contains kubernetes.client provided parameters of a token request.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**audiences** | **[str]** | Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences. | 
**bound_object_ref** | [**V1BoundObjectReference**](V1BoundObjectReference.md) |  | [optional] 
**expiration_seconds** | **int** | ExpirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the request. The token issuer may return a token with a different validity duration so a kubernetes.client needs to check the &#39;expiration&#39; field in a response. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
