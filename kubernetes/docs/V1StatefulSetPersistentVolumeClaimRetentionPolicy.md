StatefulSetPersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes the policy used for PVCs created from the StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**when_deleted** | **str** | WhenDeleted specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is deleted. The default policy of &#x60;Retain&#x60; causes PVCs to not be affected by StatefulSet deletion. The &#x60;Delete&#x60; policy causes those PVCs to be deleted. | [optional] 
**when_scaled** | **str** | WhenScaled specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is scaled down. The default policy of &#x60;Retain&#x60; causes PVCs to not be affected by a scaledown. The &#x60;Delete&#x60; policy causes the associated PVCs for any excess pods above the replica count to be deleted. | [optional]
