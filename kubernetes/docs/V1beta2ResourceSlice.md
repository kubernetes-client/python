# V1beta2ResourceSlice

ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.  At the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple <driver name>, <pool name>, <device name>.  Whenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.  When allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.  For resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.  This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**api_version** | **str** | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources | [optional]
**kind** | **str** | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | [optional]
**metadata** | [**V1ObjectMeta**](V1ObjectMeta.md) |  | [optional]
**spec** | [**V1beta2ResourceSliceSpec**](V1beta2ResourceSliceSpec.md) |  |

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1beta2_resource_slice import V1beta2ResourceSlice

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1beta2ResourceSlice from a JSON string
v1beta2_resource_slice_instance = V1beta2ResourceSlice.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1beta2ResourceSlice.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1beta2_resource_slice_dict = v1beta2_resource_slice_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1beta2ResourceSlice from a dict
v1beta2_resource_slice_from_dict = V1beta2ResourceSlice.from_dict(v1beta2_resource_slice_dict)
