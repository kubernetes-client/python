# V1beta1VolumeNodeResources

VolumeNodeResources is a set of resource limits for scheduling of volumes.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**count** | **int** | Maximum number of unique volumes managed by the CSI driver that can be used on a node. A volume that is both attached and mounted on a node is considered to be used once, not twice. The same rule applies for a unique volume that is shared among multiple pods on the same node. If this field is nil, then the supported number of volumes on this node is unbounded. | [optional]
