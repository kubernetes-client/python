# V1RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy

RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategy is used to communicate parameter for RollingUpdateStatefulSetStrategyType.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**max_unavailable** | [**object**](.md) | The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0. Defaults to 1. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the MaxUnavailableStatefulSet feature. The field applies to all pods in the range 0 to Replicas-1. That means if there is any unavailable pod in the range 0 to Replicas-1, it will be counted towards MaxUnavailable. | [optional] 
**partition** | **int** | Partition indicates the ordinal at which the StatefulSet should be partitioned for updates. During a rolling update, all pods from ordinal Replicas-1 to Partition are updated. All pods from ordinal Partition-1 to 0 remain untouched. This is helpful in being able to do a canary based deployment. The default value is 0. | [optional]
