# V1beta2ScaleStatus

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**replicas** | **int** | actual number of observed instances of the scaled object. | 
**selector** | **dict(str, str)** | label query over pods that should match the replicas count. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels#label-selectors | [optional] 
**target_selector** | **str** | label selector for pods that should match the replicas count. This is a serializated version of both map-based and more expressive set-based selectors. This is done to avoid introspection in the clients. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax. If the target type only supports map-based selectors, both this field and map-based selector field are populated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors | [optional]
