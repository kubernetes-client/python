# V1TopologySpreadConstraint

TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**label_selector** | [**V1LabelSelector**](V1LabelSelector.md) |  | [optional] 
**max_skew** | **int** | MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When &#x60;whenUnsatisfiable&#x3D;DoNotSchedule&#x60;, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When &#x60;whenUnsatisfiable&#x3D;ScheduleAnyway&#x60;, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It&#39;s a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed. | 
**topology_key** | **str** | TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each &lt;key, value&gt; as a \&quot;bucket\&quot;, and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It&#39;s a required field. | 
**when_unsatisfiable** | **str** | WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn&#39;t satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,   but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the   skew. A constraint is considered \&quot;Unsatisfiable\&quot; for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate \&quot;MaxSkew\&quot; on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won&#39;t make it *more* imbalanced. It&#39;s a required field.  Possible enum values:  - &#x60;\&quot;DoNotSchedule\&quot;&#x60; instructs the scheduler not to schedule the pod when constraints are not satisfied.  - &#x60;\&quot;ScheduleAnyway\&quot;&#x60; instructs the scheduler to schedule the pod even if constraints are not satisfied. |
