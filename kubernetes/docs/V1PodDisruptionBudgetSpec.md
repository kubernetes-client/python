PodDisruptionBudgetSpec is a description of a PodDisruptionBudget.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**max_unavailable** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | An eviction is allowed if at most \&quot;maxUnavailable\&quot; pods selected by \&quot;selector\&quot; are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with \&quot;minAvailable\&quot;. | [optional] 
**min_available** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | An eviction is allowed if at least \&quot;minAvailable\&quot; pods selected by \&quot;selector\&quot; will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying \&quot;100%\&quot;. | [optional] 
**selector** | [**V1LabelSelector**](V1LabelSelector.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
