Python client for the [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) API.

## Installation

From source:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python.git
cd python
python setup.py install
```

From [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kubernetes/) directly:

```
pip install kubernetes
```

## Examples

list all pods:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Configs can be set in Configuration class directly or using helper utility
config.load_kube_config()

v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
print("Listing pods with their IPs:")
ret = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
for i in ret.items:
    print("%s\t%s\t%s" % (i.status.pod_ip, i.metadata.namespace, i.metadata.name))
```

watch on namespace object:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config, watch

# Configs can be set in Configuration class directly or using helper utility
config.load_kube_config()

v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
count = 10
w = watch.Watch()
for event in w.stream(v1.list_namespace, _request_timeout=60):
    print("Event: %s %s" % (event['type'], event['object'].metadata.name))
    count -= 1
    if not count:
        w.stop()

print("Ended.")
```

More examples can be found in [examples](examples/) folder. To run examples, run this command:

```shell
python -m examples.example1
```

(replace example1 with one of the filenames in the examples folder)

## Documentation

All APIs and Models' documentation can be found at the [Generated client's README file](kubernetes/README.md)

## Compatibility

`client-python` follows [semver](http://semver.org/), so until the major version of
client-python gets increased, your code will continue to work with explicitly
supported versions of Kubernetes clusters.

#### Compatibility matrix

|                    | Kubernetes 1.13 | Kubernetes 1.14 | Kubernetes 1.15 |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| client-python 9.0  |✓                |+-               |+-               |
| client-python 10.0 |+-               |✓                |+-               |
| client-python 11.0 |+-               |+-               |✓                |
| client-python HEAD |+-               |+-               |+-               |

Key:

* `✓` Exactly the same features / API objects in both client-python and the Kubernetes
  version.
* `+` client-python has features or API objects that may not be present in the Kubernetes
 cluster, either due to that client-python has additional new API, or that the server has
 removed old API. However, everything they have in common (i.e., most APIs) will work.
 Please note that alpha APIs may vanish or change significantly in a single release.
* `-` The Kubernetes cluster has features the client-python library can't use, either due
 to the server has additional new API, or that client-python has removed old API. However,
 everything they share in common (i.e., most APIs) will work.

See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed description of changes
between client-python versions.

Key:

* `✓` Changes in main Kubernetes repo are manually ([should be automated](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/177)) published to client-python when they are available.
* `✗` No longer maintained; please upgrade.

Kubernetes supports [three minor releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/release/versioning.md#supported-releases-and-component-skew) at a time. "Support" means we expect users to be running that version in production, though we may not port fixes back before the latest minor version. For example, when v1.3 comes out, v1.0 will no longer be supported. In consistent with Kubernetes support policy, we expect to support **three GA major releases** (corresponding to three Kubernetes minor releases) at a time.

Note: There would be no maintenance for alpha/beta releases except the latest one.

## Community, Support, Discussion

If you have any problem on using the package or any suggestions, please start with reaching the [Kubernetes clients slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C76GB48RK/), or filing an [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues) to let us know. You can also reach the maintainers of this project at [SIG API Machinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery), where this project falls under.

### Code of Conduct

Participation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Troubleshooting

### SSLError on macOS

If you get an SSLError, you likely need to update your version of python. The
version that ships with macOS may not be supported.

Install the latest version of python with [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install python
```

Once installed, you can query the version of OpenSSL like so:

```
python -c "import ssl; print ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION"
```

You'll need a version with OpenSSL version 1.0.0 or later.

### Hostname doesn't match

If you get an `ssl.CertificateError` complaining about hostname match, your installed packages does not meet version [requirements](requirements.txt).
Specifically check `ipaddress` and `urllib3` package versions to make sure they met requirements in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

### Why Exec/Attach calls doesn't work

Starting from 4.0 release, we do not support directly calling exec or attach calls. you should use stream module to call them. so instead
of `resp = api.connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec(name, ...` you should call `resp = stream(api.connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec, name, ...`.

Using Stream will overwrite the requests protocol in _core_v1_api.CoreV1Api()_
This will cause a failure in  non-exec/attach calls. If you reuse your api client object, you will need to
recreate it between api calls that use _stream_ and other api calls.

See more at [exec example](examples/pod_exec.py).
