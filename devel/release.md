# Release process

Release process of python client involve creating (or updating) a release
branch, update release tags, create distribution packages and upload them to
pip.

## Change logs
Make sure changes logs are up to date [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
If they are not, follow commits added after last release and update/commit
the change logs to master.

## Release branch

Release branch name should have release-x.x format. All minor and pre-releases
should be on the same branch. To update an existing branch:

```bash
export RELEASE_BRANCH=release-x.x
git checkout $RELEASE_BRANCH
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/$RELEASE_BRANCH
git pull upstream master
```

You may need to fix some conflicts. For auto-generated files, you can commit
either version. They will be updated to the current version in the next step.

## Sanity check generated client
We need to make sure there is no API changes after running update client
scripts. Such changes should be committed to master branch first. Run this
command:

```bash
scripts/update-client.sh
```

And make sure there is no API change (version number changes should be fine
as they will be updated in next step anyway). Do not commit any changes at
this step and go back to master branch if there is any API changes.

## Update release tags

Release tags are in scripts/constants.py file. These are the constants you may
need to update:

CLIENT_VERSION: Client version should follow x.y.zDn where x,y,z are version
numbers (integers) and D is one of "a" for alpha or "b" for beta and n is the
pre-release number. For a final release, "Dn" part should be omitted. Examples:
1.0.0a1, 2.0.1b2, 1.5.1.

SPEC_VERSION: This would be the kubernetes OpenAPI spec version. It should be
deprecated after kubernetes/kubernetes#37055 takes effect.

DEVELOPMENT_STATUS: Update it to one of the values of "Development Status"
in [this list](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers).

after changing constants to proper versions, update the client using this
command:

```bash
scripts/update-client.sh
```

and commit changes (should be only version number changes) to the release branch.
Name the commit something like "Update version constants for XXX release".

```bash
git push upstream $RELEASE_BRANCH
```

## Make distribution packages
First make sure you are using a clean version of python. Use virtualenv and
pyenv packages, make sure you are using python 2.7.12. I would normally do this
on a clean machine:

(install [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#installation))
(install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/))
(install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/))

```bash
git clean -xdf
pyenv install 2.7.12
pyenv global 2.7.12
virtualenv .release
source .release/bin/activate
python --version     # Make sure you get Python 2.7.12
pip install twine
```

Now we need to create a "~/.pypirc" with this content:

```
[distutils]
index-servers=pypi

[pypi]
repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
username = kubernetes
```

TODO: we should be able to pass these parameters to twine directly. My first attempt failed.

Now that the environment is ready, lets create distribution packages:

```bash
python setup.py sdist
python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
ls dist/
```

You should see two files in dist folder. kubernetes\*.whl and kubernetes\*.tar.gz.

TODO: We need a dry-run option an some way to test package upload process to pypi.

If everything looks good, run this command to upload packages to pypi:

```
twine upload dist/*
```

## Create github release

Create a gihub release by starting from
[this page](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/releases).
Click Deaft new release button. Name the tag the same as CLIENT_VERSION. Change
the target branch to "release-x.y". If the release is a pre-release, check the
`This is a pre-release` option.


## Cleanup

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf .release
```

TODO: Convert steps in this document to an (semi-) automated script.
